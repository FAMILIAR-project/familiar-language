<p>Action modules providing layout algorithms for use by prefuse visualizations.
All provided layouts descend from the abstract
{@link prefuse.action.layout.Layout} class, allowing 
the layout bounds and anchor point to be customized on a per-Action basis. 
Layouts specifically for graph or tree structured data are available in the 
{@link prefuse.action.layout.graph} package.</p>
