<p>Classes for representing and storing VisualItems. In addition to the top
level {@link prefuse.visual.VisualItem} interface, 
{@link prefuse.visual.NodeItem} and {@link prefuse.visual.EdgeItem} provide
access to an underlying graph structure, {@link prefuse.visual.DecoratorItem}
represents a VisualItem "attached to" or "decorating" another VisualItem,
and {@link prefuse.visual.AggregateItem} represents an aggregated collection
of VisualItems.</p>

<p>VisualItems descend from the {@link prefuse.data.Tuple} interface, and
as such are actually object proxies for a row of a data table. This package
includes the corresponding table and graph implementations, which have been tuned
to the needs of the visual abstraction. More implementational machinery for 
these types is in the {@link prefuse.visual.tuple} package.</p>
