<p>Implementing classes for data tuples, object proxies to a row of table
data. Prefuse data tables can be accessed and manipulated directly, indexed
by row numbers, but that is not always the most convenient. The 
{@link prefuse.data.Tuple}
interface provides an object-relational mapping, providing an object-oriented
interface to a row of table data. Furthermore, tuples provide enhanced
safety, as a deleted row will result in an invalidated tuple, while a
row index provides no such guarantees.</p>

<p>Groups of tuples can be collected and monitored using the 
{@link prefuse.data.tuple.TupleSet}
interface, which {@link prefuse.data.Table}, {@link prefuse.data.Graph}, and
{@link prefuse.data.Tree} all implement. Other TupleSet instances can
be used to collect Tuples from any number of backing tables
({@link prefuse.data.tuple.DefaultTupleSet}) or aggregate multiple
TupleSets ({@link prefuse.data.tuple.CompositeTupleSet}).</p>

<p>Graph nodes and edges are also represented as Tuples, with additional
methods for accessing the underlying graph structure. Any methods that
reference a tree structure will first request a spanning tree from the
backing graph.</p>

<p>Tuples are created and stored by 
{@link prefuse.data.tuple.TupleManager} instances. To
customize tuple creation, one needs to register the appropriate
concrete Tuple type with an enclosing data table. This is done
using the {@link prefuse.data.Table#Table(int,int,Class)}
constructor.</p>
