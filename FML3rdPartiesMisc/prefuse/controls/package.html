<p>Control modules for incorporating interaction in prefuse Displays.
Examples include clicking a node to make it the new focus, dragging nodes to
change their position, and performing pan and zoom operations. To add
one of these controls to a visualization, create a new instance of
the desired control and register it using the
{@link prefuse.Display#addControlListener(Control)} method of the
{@link prefuse.Display} class. Custom Controls can easily be constructed
by implementing the {@link prefuse.controls.Control} interface, or, more
conveniently, by subclassing the {@link prefuse.controls.ControlAdapter}
class.</p>
