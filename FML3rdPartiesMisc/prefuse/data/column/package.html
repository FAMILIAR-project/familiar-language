<p>Data columns for storing typed data within a data table.
In most cases, these classes should not be
instantiated directly. Instead use the setColumn() methods of
the {@link prefuse.data.Table} class, which will call the
appropriate {@link prefuse.data.column.ColumnFactory} method for you.</p>
