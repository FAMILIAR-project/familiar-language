<p>Dynamic query bindings and data range models for creating
dynamic queries. A dynamic query binding takes a particular
data column and creates a binding between a filtering predicate
over the data and user interface widgets for controlling the
parameters of the predicate. This includes queries over a
range of data ({@link prefuse.data.query.RangeQueryBinding}), selecting between 
different categories of data ({@link prefuse.data.query.ListQueryBinding}),
and text search ({@link prefuse.data.query.SearchQueryBinding}).</p>
