/* 
 * After the type declarations comes the feature diagram itself.  It starts with the root feature, which must be 
 * preceded by the keyword "root". A feature block consists of the following 
 *  - The feature constraints
 *  - The feature attributes
 *  - The children of the feature There are two ways to specify the children of a feature
 *      1) The "hierarchical" way Fully specify the child feature in this place (the complete feature block)
 *    	2) The "grammatical" way  Only specify the ID (and optional state) of the child feature (without its block). 
 *    	   The details of the child feature (its block) is provided later in the file. 
 * 
 * More generally, the definition of a feature can be spread over an arbitrary number of feature blocks.  This is 
 * semantically equivalent to specifying a single definition with the lines that are otherwise spread.  The compiler 
 * will simply join the contents of each of the blocks.  The children block of a feature can only be specified in one 
 * piece, though (it cannot be spread over different blocks).
 * 
 * 
 * In our example, the children of the feature "computer" are specified in the grammatical way.  The group statement 
 * contains only the ID of the child features and the user has chosen to specify the attributes and the constraints later.
 *
 * The cardinality of the group statement ("[x..y]") shows the minimum ("x") and maximum ("y") number of children 
 * features.  One can use the wildcard char * to indicate the maximum number of features.
 * 
 * Instead of using cardinalities, one can also use the standard decomposition operators "oneof", "allof", "noneof".

	 * 3) The domain of the attribute "in { enumaritive list, .. }" "in [interval]" (optionnal)
	 * 4) The value the attribute takes when its parent feature is selected "ifin ..." (optionnal)
	 * 5) The value the attribute takes when its parent feature is deselected "ifout ..." (optional)
	 *
	 * The value is simply an expression with the type of the attribute.  The syntax for these expressions
	 * is as expected (operators + - * / for numeric expressions and && || ==> <=> ! for boolean expressions.
	 * In addition, there are a number of aggregation operators, such as sum, max, min, mult, count, 
	 * avg for numeric attributes as well as and, or, xor for boolean attributes.

	 * Inside these aggregation operators, one can also make use of special keywords to range over the 
	 * child features of the feature the attribute belongs to
	 *	 - "children.ATTRIBUTE" denotes the value of ATTRIBUTE of all the child features
	 *   - "selectedChildren.ATTRIBUTE" denotes the the value of ATTRIBUTE of the selected child features only
	 * The attribute ATTRIBUTE has to declared for all the child features, all with the same type, and the type
	 * has to match the aggregation function.
	 *
	 * An attribute may be referenced in two ways 
	 *  1) FEATURE.ATTRIBUTE, where FEATURE is the name of the parent feature and ATTRIBUTE the name of the attribute
	 *  2) FEATURE1.FEATURE2.ATTRIBUTE, where FEATURE1.FEATURE2 is a path in the diagram.
	 *  3) Using a number of keywords
	 *      - this.ATTRIBUTE denotes an attribute of the current feature
	 *      - parent.ATTRIBUTE denotes an attribute of the parent of the current feature. This cannot be used
	 *        if the feature has more then one parent.
	 *
	 * In case of a struct, the fields of the struct can be referenced with dots as well FEATURE.ATTRIBUTE.SUBATTRIBUTE.
