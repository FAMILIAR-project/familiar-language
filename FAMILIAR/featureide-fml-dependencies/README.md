# Ad-hoc, external dependencies 

FeatureIDE jars + SAT4J core
We are a bit disconnected from FeatureIDE, so we need to save the JARs (legacy).
A way to include these jars is through a Maven plugin (but I failed with existing solutions) 
I chose a script to locally include JARS into the local repo. 
Pros: best practices
Cons: hard to share the process   

2.3.5.v20130525

Mostly to build the standalone FAMILIAR; also useful for WebFML
