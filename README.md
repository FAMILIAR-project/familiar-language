FAMILIAR language
=================

This is the repository for hosting the source code of FAMILIAR. 

# Installation
## As Eclipse plugin
### Requirements
 * Apache Maven
 * An Eclipse with Xtext 
 * FeatureIDE from [http://wwwiti.cs.uni-magdeburg.de/iti_db/research/featureide/deploy/plugins/]
   Copy these plugins in the 'dropin' folder of your Eclipse installation
   - de.ovgu.featureide.core
   - de.ovgu.featureide.fm.core
   - de.ovgu.featureide.fm.ui
   - de.ovgu.featureide.ui

### Build
 * Build the familiar.root project with ```mvn install```
 * Copy all .jar generated by the previous command in the 'dropin' folder of your Eclipse installation.
They are loacted in the 'target' folder in each project:
   - FAMILIAR
   - FML3rdPartiesForSynthesis
   - FML3rdPartiesMisc
   - org.xtext.example.fml
   - org.xtext.example.fml.ui
   - org.xtext.example.fmlero
   - org.xtext.example.fmlero.ui
   - S2T2toFML
   - SPLAR-plugin
   - TVLPackagedAsMock

## As standalone
### Requirements
 * Apache Maven
 
### Build
 * For building the plugins, in ``familiar.root``, launch ```mvn install``` (```mvn install -DskipTests``` is even preferable since tests may not pass): the command builds all jars of each project in the respective "target" folders. Note that the jars are not executable, but are Eclipse plugins
 * For building an executable jar, in ``familiar.standalone``, launch ```mvn package```: the command aggregates all previous jars into one executable jar (in the folder "target", ends up with "-jar-with-dependencies.jar")
 * For executing the tests, in ``familiar.test``, launch ```mvn integration-test```
