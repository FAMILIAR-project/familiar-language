FAMILIAR language
=================

This is the repository for hosting the source code of FAMILIAR. 

The repo is currently "private" for two reasons:
 * we still have to fix the License (GPL, LGPL or EPL) and the GPL licence of FeatureIDE is a kind of problem at the moment 
 * we can easily have experimental, research-oriented and non visible branches (but I guess we can manage this with a public repo)

How to?
